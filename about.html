    <h1>Artist Bio</h1>

    <p>José Lara Menéndez is a visual figurative artist who holds a Bachelors of Fine Arts from
        Concordia University (2022) and is now continuing their studies as an MFA candidate there. The
        artist creates surrealist dreamlike scenes featuring cartoon figures navigating otherworldly
        spaces. Menéndez is the recipient of the SSHRC Master's program scholarship (2025), the Dale
        and Nick Tedeschi Studio Scholarship (2024), the Tom Hopkins Memorial Graduate Scholarship
        (2024), and the Research and Creation grant from the Canada Council for the Arts (2022). In
        2022, they participated in the Art Volt mentorship program. Menéndez has exhibited their work
        across Montreal and Canada, and in 2024, joined the Art Volt Collection.</p>

    <h1>Artist Statement </h1>

    <p>My practice delves into themes of identity, gender, alienation, and the dissonance of time. I
        explore these ideas through dreamlike compositions of ambiguous, liminal spaces to evoke a
        sense of eeriness and emotional states of transition, disorientation, and excavation.</p>

    <p>The figures I depict are caught between fictional characters and self-portraiture, suspended
        between past and future selves. They often appear in moments of pause or dislocation. Are they
        escaping, entering, regressing, or moving forward? The scenes, lit from unclear sources, omit a
        disjointed atmosphere and suggest alternate realities and paranormal states. Lingering hints of
        auras and vibrational light sources appear in my figures, insinuating an indistinguishable
        experience and a supra-sensorial expansion of the body to the outside world.</p>

    <p>Drawing on my interests in queer theory, particularly Jack Halberstam's writing on queer failure
        and queer time, my work considers nonlinear queer temporality through elements reminiscent of
        structures of time such as surreally integrated calendars and depictions of spacetime. Through
        this, I strive to challenge colonial perspectives on gender and self-worth, the relentless pace of
        productivity culture, and the “hurry sickness” that distorts our sense of worth and presence,
        which often clashes with how I move through the world as a trans and autistic person of
        Guatemalan and Salvadoran heritage. </p>

    <p>I consider my works as portals into internal landscapes simultaneously shaped by gender
        dysphoria and gender euphoria. The combination of socio-cultural references and domestic
        elements in my compositions becomes a visual cue for psychological tensions. These
        references converge to reflect the environmental and social constraints I navigate under
        capitalism. These contradictions surface as ambiguous expressions, distorted environments,
        and temporal dissonance. </p>

    <p>Ultimately, my work carves out spaces of self-affirmation and different modes of being. Through
        the otherworldly, I aim to find a shared humanity of my personal experiences and to offer
        viewers glimpses into states of indeterminacy, resilience, and transformation.</p>
